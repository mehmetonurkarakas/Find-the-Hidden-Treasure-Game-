# Find-the-Hidden-Treasure-Game-
Multi-dimensional array, matrix,dynamÄ±c memory allocation

In this experiment, it is aimed to find the hidden treasure within a treasure map designed as
a matrix. For this purpose, the map and key data must be read from the file. Afterwards,
the key must be moved on the map depending on the rules. The result of the multiplication
of the map matrix and the key matrix will give an idea of the place of the treasure.
